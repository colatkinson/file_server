File Server
===
A really shitty file server

## Why would you make this?
Basically, I got tired of giving my friends textbook PDFs through physical media. Also, I needed somewhere to put my R.A. Martin fanfics.

## Usage
Just clone the repo, do an `npm install`, and then `npm start`. Bam, have fun.

## Contributors
Pull requests welcome. Pls.
